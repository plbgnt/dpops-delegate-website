#Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is   
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, …)
#             * refactor
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * chore (maintain)
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in   
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not             
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The <body> should include the motivation for the change and      
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in   
#    imperative present tense 
#  - The <footer> should contain any information about Breaking       
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that   
#    this commit closes
# --------------------
# Remember to
#    * Capitalize the subject line
#    * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    * Do not end the subject line with a period
#    * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    * Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
